# Backend

Syncplayer is a multi platform app. That is why we built API endpoints to connect all those platforms to backend servers for cross-platform communication.

SyncPlayer backend comprises of:

1. SyncPlayer Web:
   A. Website for using syncplayer in internet browser and without any installations.
   B. Contains all the same functionality as of mobile apps.
   C. Light, faster and more portable in usage.
